# One Liner

Ever want to write really nice looking one liners in java? Tired of wasting entire **kilobytes** of space because of useless comments and new line characters? 

Well, One Liner is the solution for you:
1. User has option to get rid of all comments
2. Gets rid of all new line characters, tabs, and other things that waste memory
3. Provides you with a single line of Java code that is compilable and can still be run
4. Reads directly from Java file and can override the same file (No copy and pasting necessary!)
5. Basically the opposite of check style (space savings are key)
